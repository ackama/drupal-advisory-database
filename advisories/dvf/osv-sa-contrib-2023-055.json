  "details": "<p>This module allows you to turn various data sources (Eg CSV or JSON file) into interactive visualisation. The DVF module provides a field (storage, widget &amp; formatter) that can be added to any entity. </p>\n<p>This module uses two third-party JS libraries having from low to medium vulnerabilities. One of the vulnerabilities is a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability that may affect Drupal sites as a Persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (i.e. not reflected). This release updates the libraries.</p>\n<p>The issue is mitigated by the fact an attacker needs the permission to create or edit content that is displayed using the Data Visualization Framework.</p>",
