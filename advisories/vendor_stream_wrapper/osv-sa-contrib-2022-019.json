Even when the vendor directory is moved outside the webroot, it allows providing publically accessible URLs to these files.</p>\n<p>The module exposes all files that are in the vendor directory, without a site owner's knowledge or intention. This could be undesirable behavior, especially since this module is required as a dependency by other modules.</p>\n<p><em>Edited October 24, 2023 after the project has been re-supported by new maintainers and this advisory metadata affects composer.</em></p>\n<p><del>The security team is marking this project unsupported.
