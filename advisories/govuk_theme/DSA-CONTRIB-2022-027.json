  "details": "The GOV.UK Theme (`govuk_theme`) is a Drupal theme for the GOV.UK Design System.\n\nThe theme doesn't sanitize user input in certain cases, which leads to Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker that can create or edit certain entities or configuration may be able to exploit one or more Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to target visitors of the site, including site admins with privileged access.\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated by the facts, that:\n\n* An attacker must have one of several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only assigned to either editors, site builders or administrators.\n* For some of the vulnerabilities, certain contributed modules must be enabled.",
