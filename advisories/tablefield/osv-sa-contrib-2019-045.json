  "details": "This module allows you to attach tabular data to an entity.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently determine that the data being unserialized is the contents of a tablefield when users request a CSV export, which could lead to Remote Code Execution via Object Injection.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission 'export tablefield', and be able to insert a payload into an entity's field.",
