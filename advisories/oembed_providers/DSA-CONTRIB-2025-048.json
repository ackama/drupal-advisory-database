  ],
  "details": "This module extends the core Media module and allows site creators to permit oEmbed providers in addition to YouTube and Vimeo, which are deemed trustworthy by the Drupal Security Team.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently mark its administrative permission as restricted, creating the possibility for the permission to be granted too broadly and to users without the ability to adequately vet providers. A malicious provider could execute a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must 1) have a role with the permission \"administer oembed providers\", 2) have a role with the ability to create or edit Media entities, and 3) have provisioned a publicly-accessible, malicious provider.",
