  "details": "<p>This module enables you to delete any types of entities in bulk.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't sufficiently verify access permissions under its use cases, leading to access bypass. The module also does not protect against Cross Site Request Forgeries on its delete process.</p>\n<p>The access bypass vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"access content\". There is no additional mitigation for the Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability.</p>",
