  "details": "The Ubercart module provides a shopping cart and e-commerce features for Drupal.\n\nThe order module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input when displayed on an invoice leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"edit orders\".",
