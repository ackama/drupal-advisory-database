  "details": "This advisory addresses a similar issue to [Drupal core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Request Forgery - SA-CORE-2021-006](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2021-006).\n\nThe Entity Embed module provides a filter to allow embedding entities in content fields. In certain circumstances, the filter could allow an unprivileged user to inject HTML into a page when it is accessed by a trusted user with permission to embed entities. In some cases, this could lead to cross-site scripting.",
