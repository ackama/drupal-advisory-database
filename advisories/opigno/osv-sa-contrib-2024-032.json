  "details": "The Opigno module is related to Opigno LMS distribution. Opigno Scorm submodule exposes an API for extracting and handling SCORM packages.\n\nUploaded files were not sufficiently validated to prevent arbitrary file uploads, which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and/or Cross Site Scripting (XSS).\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it affected only specific activity types.",
