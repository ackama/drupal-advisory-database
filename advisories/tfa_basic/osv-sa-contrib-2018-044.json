  "details": "The TFA Basic module enables you to use Two Factor Authentication via a variety of plugins including TOTP and one-time codes delivered via email or sms.\n\nThe module doesn't use a strong source of randomness, creating weak and predictable one-time login codes that are then delivered using SMS. This weakness does not affect the more common TOTP second factor.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the site must be configured to use SMS to deliver one-time login codes which is an uncommon configuration.",
