  "details": "<p>The ACL module, short for Access Control Lists, is an API for other modules to create lists of users and give them access to nodes.</p>\n<p>The module processes user input in a way that could be unsafe. This can lead to Remote Code Execution via Object Injection.</p>\n<p>As this is an API module, it is only exploitable if a \"client\" module exposes the vulnerability. Details of some contributed client modules are given below. Custom modules using ACL could also expose the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker typically needs an \"admin\"-type permission provided by one of ACL's client modules.</p>\n<p>Known client modules include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forum Access</li>\n<li>Flexi Access</li>\n<li>Content Access</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coordinated Security Advisories are being released for those client modules that have  Security coverage.</p>",
