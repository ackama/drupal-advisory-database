  "details": "<p>This module enables you to prevent existing users from logging in to your Drupal site unless they know the secret key to add to the end of the ?q=user login form page.</p>\n<p>The Login Disable module does not correctly prevent a user with a disabled login from logging in, allowing those users to by-pass the protection offered by the module.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must already have a user account to log in. This bug therefore allows users to log in even if their login is disabled.</p>",
