  "details": "This module enables you to analyze the content that you're authoring for a website. It shows you a preview of what a search result might look like.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently escape the metadata from content while rendering the preview, opening up the possibility of a XSS attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must be able to author content that is analyzed by the Real-Time SEO module.",
