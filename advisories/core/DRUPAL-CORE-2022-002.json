  "details": "jQuery UI is a third-party library used by Drupal. This library was previously thought to be end-of-life.\n\nLate in 2021, jQuery UI announced that they would be continuing development, and released a [jQuery UI 1.13.0](https://blog.jqueryui.com/2021/10/jquery-ui-1-13-0-released/) version. In addition to the issue covered by [SA-CORE-2022-001](/sa-core-2022-001), further security vulnerabilities disclosed in jQuery UI 1.13.0 may affect Drupal 7 only:\n\n* CVE-2021-41182: [XSS in the altField option of the Datepicker widget](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-9gj3-hwp5-pmwc)\n* CVE-2021-41183: [XSS in \\*Text options of the Datepicker widget](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-j7qv-pgf6-hvh4)\n\nFurthermore, other vulnerabilities listed below were previously unaddressed in the version of jQuery UI included in Drupal 7 or in the [jQuery Update](/project/jquery_update) module:\n\n* CVE-2016-7103: [XSS in closeText option of Dialog](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7103)\n* CVE-2010-5312: [XSS in the title option of Dialog](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-5312) (applicable only to the jQuery UI version included in D7 core)\n\nIt is possible that these vulnerabilities are exploitable via contributed Drupal modules or custom code. As a precaution, this Drupal security release applies the fix for the above cross-site scripting issues, without making other changes to the jQuery UI version that is included in Drupal.\n\nThis advisory is not covered by [Drupal Steward](/steward).\n\n### Important note regarding the jQuery Update contrib module\n\nThese backport fixes in D7 have also been tested with the version of jQuery UI provided by the most recent releases of the jQuery Update module (jQuery UI 1.10.2) and the fixes confirmed. Therefore, there is no accompanying security release for jQuery Update.\n\nHowever, in early 2022 the currently supported release of jQuery Update (7.x-2.7 from 2015) will be deprecated and replaced by a new release from the 7.x-4.x branch. The stable release from that branch will then be the only release considered by Drupal Security Team when new jQuery security issues arise.\n\nPlease check the [jQuery Update project page](/project/jquery_update) for more details, and for announcements when the changes are made to supported releases.",
