An attacker that can create or edit content may be able to exploit this Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to target users with access to the WYSIWYG CKEditor, and this may include site admins with privileged access.</p>\n<p>The latest versions of Drupal update CKEditor to 4.14 to mitigate the vulnerabilities.</p>",
