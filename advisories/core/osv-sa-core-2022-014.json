  "summary": "",
  "details": "<p><em>Updated 2022-07-20 19:45 UTC to indicate that this only affects Apache web servers.</em></p>\n<p>Drupal core sanitizes filenames with dangerous extensions upon upload (reference: <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-012\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA-CORE-2020-012</a>) and strips leading and trailing dots from filenames to prevent uploading server configuration files (reference: <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-010\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA-CORE-2019-010</a>). </p>\n<p>However, the protections for these two vulnerabilities previously did not work correctly together. As a result, if the site were configured to allow the upload of files with an <code class=\"language-php\">htaccess</code> extension, these files' filenames would not be properly sanitized. This could allow bypassing the protections provided by Drupal core's default <code class=\"language-php\">.htaccess</code> files and possible remote code execution on Apache web servers.</p>\n<p>This issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires a field administrator to explicitly configure a file field to allow <code class=\"language-php\">htaccess</code> as an extension (a restricted permission), or a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed file uploads.</p>",
