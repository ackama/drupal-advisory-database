  "summary": "",
  "details": "<p>In some situations, the Image module does not correctly check access to image files not stored in the standard public files directory when generating derivative images using the image styles system.</p>\n<p>Access to a non-public file is checked only if it is stored in the \"private\" file system. However, some contributed modules provide additional file systems, or schemes, which may lead to this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only applies when the site sets (Drupal 9) <code class=\"language-php\">$config['image.settings']['allow_insecure_derivatives']</code> or (Drupal 7) <code class=\"language-php\">$conf['image_allow_insecure_derivatives']</code> to TRUE. The recommended and default setting is FALSE, and Drupal core does not provide a way to change that in the admin UI.</p>\n<p>Some sites may require configuration changes following this security release. Review the release notes for your Drupal version if you have issues accessing files or image styles after updating.</p>",
