  "details": "<p>The file download facility doesn't sufficiently sanitize file paths in certain situations. This may result in users gaining access to private files that they should not have access to.</p>\n<p>Some sites may require configuration changes following this security release. Review the release notes for your Drupal version if you have issues accessing private files after updating.</p>\n<p>This advisory <strong>is</strong> covered by <a href=\"/steward\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal Steward</a>. Because this vulnerability is not mass exploitable, your Steward partner may respond by monitoring-only, rather than enforcing a new WAF rule.</p>\n<p>We would normally not apply for a release of this severity. However, in this case we have chosen to apply Drupal Steward security coverage to test our processes. </p>\n<h4>Drupal 7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All Drupal 7 sites on Windows web servers are vulnerable.</li>\n<li>Drupal 7 sites on Linux web servers are vulnerable with certain file directory structures, or if a vulnerable contributed or custom file access module is installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Drupal 9 and 10</h4>\n<p>Drupal 9 and 10 sites are only vulnerable if certain contributed or custom file access modules are installed.</p>",
