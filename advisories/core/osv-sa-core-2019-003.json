  "details": "<p>Some field types do not properly sanitize data from non-form sources. This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases.</p>\n<p>A site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows <strong>GET</strong>, PATCH or POST requests, or</li>\n<li>the site has another web services module enabled, like <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi\" rel=\"nofollow\">JSON:API</a> in Drupal 8, or <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/services\" rel=\"nofollow\">Services</a> or <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/restws\" rel=\"nofollow\">RESTful Web Services</a> in Drupal 7. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<em>Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at this time, but you should still apply other contributed updates associated with this advisory if Services is in use.</em>)</p>\n<h2>Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2019-02-22</strong>: Updated risk score given new information; see <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-02-22\" rel=\"nofollow\">PSA-2019-02-22</a>. The security risk score has been updated to 23/25 as there are now known exploits in the wild. In addition, any enabled REST resource end-point, <strong>even if it only accepts GET requests</strong>, is also vulnerable. Note this does not include REST exports from Views module.</li>\n</ul>",
