  "details": "<p>The Group module enables you to hand out permissions on a smaller subset, section or community of your website.</p>\n<p>Under very specific circumstances, where two group types support the same content, yet hand out different permissions, non-members of the first group type may use the set of permissions of the 2nd group type for the grouped content.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that you must already have a rare set-up and the two group types are configured in a way where one is more permissive than the other over the same type of content.</p>",
