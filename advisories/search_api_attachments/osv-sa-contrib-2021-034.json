  "details": "This module enables you to extract the textual content of files for use on a website, e.g. to display it or use it in search indexes.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently protect the administrator-defined commands that are executed on the server, which leads to post-authentication remote code execution by a limited set of users.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"administer search\\_api\". Sites are encouraged to review which roles have that permission and which users have that role, to ensure that only trusted users have that permission.",
