  "details": "<p>This base theme bridges the gap between Drupal and the Bootstrap Framework.</p>\n<p>The theme doesn't sufficiently filter valid targets under the scenario of opening modals, popovers, and tooltips.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must already have the ability to either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Edit/save custom content that supplies a value for the <code class=\"language-php\">data-target</code> attribute by injecting malicious code.</li>\n<li>Inject custom markup onto the page that further exploits the <code class=\"language-php\">data-target</code> attribute by injecting malicious code. This method of attack is highly unlikely if they already have this level of access.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: while the base-theme does not provide either of these opportunities to do this out-of-the-box; a custom sub-theme may, however, be susceptible if it didn't sanitize or filter user provided input for XSS properly.</p>",
