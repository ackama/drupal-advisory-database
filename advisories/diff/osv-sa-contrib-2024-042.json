  "summary": "",
  "details": "This module adds a tab for sufficiently permissioned users. The tab shows all revisions like standard Drupal but it also allows pretty viewing of all added/changed/deleted words between revisions.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently check revision access before rendering a diff report for 1) nodes or 2) general entities that support diff.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission from the general node permission to \"view all revisions\", one of the more specific node type permissions, \"view %bundle revisions\" or the equivalent for other general entity types.",
