  "details": "<p>This module for Drupal provides complete control of Email settings with Drupal and Mailjet.</p>\n<p>In certain cases the module doesn't securely pass data to PHP's unserialize() function, which could result in Remote Code Execution via PHP Object Injection.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attack must operate with the permission \"administer mailjet module\", however this could be the case if this issue were combined with others in an \"attack chain\".</p>",
