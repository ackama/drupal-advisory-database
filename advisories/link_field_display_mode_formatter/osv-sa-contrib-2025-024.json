  "details": "<p>This module adds a formatter for link fields that displays the current entity with another view mode inside the link. </p>\n<p>Drupal core does not sufficiently sanitize link element attributes, which can lead to a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS).</p>\n<p>A separate fix for Drupal core has been released but this module requires a concurrent release to make use of the Drupal core fix.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by that fact that an attacker would need to have the ability to add specific attributes to a Link field, which typically requires edit access via core web services, or a contrib or custom module.</p>",
