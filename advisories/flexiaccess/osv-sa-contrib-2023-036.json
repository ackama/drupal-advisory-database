  "details": "The Flexi Access module will provide a simple and flexible interface to the ACL (Access Control List) module. It will let you set up and mange ACLs naming individual users that are allowed access to a particular node.\n\nThe module processes user input in a way that could be unsafe. This can lead to Remote Code Execution via Object Injection.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that known exploit paths require an attacker to have a combination of permissions provided by the module; for example \"access flexiaccess\" and \"flexiaccess view\". See \\_flexiaccess\\_node\\_access() for details. The \"administer flexiaccess\" permission alone does not grant access to the vulnerable functionality.\n\nThis Security Advisory is being released in coordination with [SA-CONTRIB-2023-034](https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-034) for the ACL module, on which Flexi Access depends.",
