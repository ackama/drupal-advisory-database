If the third-party code relies on this data to decide whether to grant access to content, it may grant more access than was intended.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is only present in sites that have custom code calling the <code class=\"language-php\">mm_content_get_uids_in_group()</code> function with a single UID of zero (0) in the second parameter. </p>",
