  "details": "This module enables you to group nodes within pages that have a highly-granular, distributed permissions structure.\n\nA function which can be used by third-party code does not return valid data under certain rare circumstances. If the third-party code relies on this data to decide whether to grant access to content, it may grant more access than was intended.\n\nThis vulnerability is only present in sites that have custom code calling the `mm_content_get_uids_in_group()` function with a single UID of zero (0) in the second parameter.",
