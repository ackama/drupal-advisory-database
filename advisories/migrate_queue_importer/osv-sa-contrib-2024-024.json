  "details": "The Migrate queue importer module enables you to create cron migrations(configuration entities) with a reference towards migration entities in order to import them during cron runs.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently protect against Cross Site Request Forgery  \nunder specific scenarios allowing an attacker to enable/disable a cron migration.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must know the  \nid of the migration.",
