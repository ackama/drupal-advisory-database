  "details": "<p>The jQuery project released version 3.4.0, and as part of that, disclosed a security vulnerability that affects all prior versions. As described in their <a href=\"https://blog.jquery.com/2019/04/10/jquery-3-4-0-released/\" rel=\"nofollow\">release notes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>jQuery 3.4.0 includes a fix for some unintended behavior when using jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...). If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable __proto__ property, it could extend the native Object.prototype. This fix is included in jQuery 3.4.0, but patch diffs exist to patch previous jQuery versions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's possible that this vulnerability is exploitable with some Drupal modules. As a precaution, this Drupal security release backports the fix to jQuery.extend(), without making any other changes to the jQuery version that is included in Drupal core (3.2.1 for Drupal 8 and 1.4.4 for Drupal 7) or running on the site via some other module such as <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery Update</a>.</p>\n<p><em>2019-04-22, edited to add CVE.</em></p>",
