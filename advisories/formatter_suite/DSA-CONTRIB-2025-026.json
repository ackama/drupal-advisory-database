  "details": "Formatter Suite provides a suite of field formatters to help present numbers, dates, times, text, links, entity references, files, and images. The module provides a custom formatter for link fields.\n\nDrupal core does not sufficiently sanitize link element attributes, which can lead to a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS).\n\nA separate fix for Drupal core has been released but this module requires a concurrent release to make use of the Drupal core fix.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by that fact that an attacker would need to have the ability to add specific attributes to a Link field, which typically requires edit access via core web services, or a contrib or custom module.",
