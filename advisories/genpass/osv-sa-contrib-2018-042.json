  "details": "The Genpass module makes the password field optional (or hidden) on the add new user page (admin & registration). If the password field is not set during registration, the system generates a password.\n\nThe module doesn't use a strong source of randomness, creating weak and predictable passwords.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the site must be configured to reveal the password to the attacker which is a common configuration.\n\nCVE identifier(s) issued\n------------------------\n\n* *A [CVE identifier](http://cve.mitre.org/) will be requested, and added upon issuance, in accordance with Drupal Security Team processes.*",
