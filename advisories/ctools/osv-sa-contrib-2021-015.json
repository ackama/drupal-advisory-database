  "details": "<p>Chaos tool suite (ctools) module provides a number of APIs and extensions for Drupal, its 8.x-3.x branch is a start from scratch to evaluate the features of ctools that didn't make it into Drupal Core 8.0.x and port them.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't sufficiently handle block access control on its EntityView plugin. This is a followup to more fully implement the fixes from <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-009\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA-CONTRIB-2021-009</a></p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that successful exploitation requires special conditions in place such as custom blockAccess() method that differs from the default return value of 'AccessResult::allowed()' and extending from EntityView.</p>",
