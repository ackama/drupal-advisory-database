  "details": "The CKEditor module (and its predecessor, FCKeditor module) allows Drupal to replace textarea fields with CKEditor 3.x/4.x (FCKeditor 2.x in case of FCKeditor module) - a visual HTML editor, sometimes called WYSIWYG editor.\n\nDue to the usage of the JavaScript `eval()` function on non-filtered data in admin section, it was possible for a user with permission to create content visible in the admin area to inject specially crafted malicious script which causes Cross Site Scripting (XSS).\n\nThe problem existed in CKEditor module for Drupal, not in JavaScript libraries with the same names.",
