  "details": "The [Fast Autocomplete module](https://www.drupal.org/project/fac) provides fast IMDB-like suggestions below a text input field. Suggestions are stored as JSON files in the public files folder so that they can be provided to the browser relatively fast without the need for Drupal to be bootstrapped.\n\nThe module doesn't correctly generate certain hashes when the configuration option \"Perform search as anonymous user only\" is switched from the default on value to off.\n\nThis enables a malicious user to read search results generated by users with other roles, disclosing search results the user normally has no access to.",
