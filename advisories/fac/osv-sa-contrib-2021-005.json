Suggestions are stored as JSON files in the public files folder so that they can be provided to the browser relatively fast without the need for Drupal to be bootstrapped.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't correctly generate certain hashes when the configuration option \"Perform search as anonymous user only\" is switched from the default on value to off. </p>\n<p>This enables a malicious user to read search results generated by users with other roles, disclosing search results the user normally has no access to.</p>",
