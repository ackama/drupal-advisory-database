  "details": "<p>This module enables you to define a 'weekly office hours' field type, and add a field to any Content type, in order to display the weekly opening hours for a location.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't sufficiently filter user-supplied text leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker needs additional permissions. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with a role with the permission \"administer display\" regardless of other configurations. In some scenarios, the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with \"Create content\" or \"Edit content\" for a relevant Content type. </p>",
