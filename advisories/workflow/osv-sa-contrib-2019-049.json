  "details": "The Workflow module enables you to create arbitrary Workflows, and assign them to Entities.  \nThe module doesn't sufficiently escape HTML in the field settings leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  \nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"administer nodes\" and \"administer workflow\".",
