  "details": "<p>The GraphQL module enables you to build GraphQL APIs which can include data fetching through Queries and data updates (create, update, delete) through mutations.</p>\n<p>The module does not sufficiently validate incoming requests that are made from domains other than the one serving the GraphQL endpoint. In case a user visits a malicious site, that site may make requests on the users behalf which can lead to the execution of mutations, exposing a CSRF vulnerability. Whether data is returned to the malicious site depends on your sites CORS configuration.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a user with access to the API must have an active session cookie while visiting a malicious site. This vulnerability is also mitigated by restricting session cookies with the SameSite attribute (see solution below).</p>",
