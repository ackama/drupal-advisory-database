  "details": "<p>This module lets you craft and expose a GraphQL schema for Drupal 9 and 10.</p>\n<p>The module currently does not adequately verify whether a given user has the necessary permissions to access an entity's label creating an access bypass vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that entity view and entity label access are usually handled by the same access check; developers have to opt-in for supporting different logic on entity types. Additionally your schema must make use of the EntityLabel DataProducer to be affected.</p>",
