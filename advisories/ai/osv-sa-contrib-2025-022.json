  "summary": "",
  "details": "The AI Automators module (a submodule of AI) enables you to create different automated tasks that fills out a field data using LLM outputs.\n\nThe module contains a potential PHP Object Injection vulnerability that (if combined with another exploit) could lead to Arbitrary File Deletion. It may be possible to escalate this attack to Remote Code Execution. It is not directly exploitable.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that for it to be exploitable, a separate vulnerability must be present to allow an attacker to pass unsafe input to `unserialize()`. The potential vulnerability exists in optional Automator Types which are part of the optional AI Automators (sub)module.\n\nThe AI module is included in Drupal CMS.",
