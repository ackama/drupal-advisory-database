  "details": "<p>This module enables you to \"clone\" a content entity, i.e. to create a new content pre-filled with data from another entity of the same type and bundle.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't properly check the user access to the original entity, allowing users to create a new entity (they have permission to create) pre-filled with content from another entity of the same type and bundle that they would normally not have access to.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the permission to create content of the type of the entity to clone.</p>",
