  "summary": "",
  "details": "This module allows users to export nodes and then import it into another Drupal installation, or on the same site.\n\nIn certain cases the module doesn't sufficiently sanitize data before passing it to PHP's unserialize() function, which could results in Remote Code Execution via PHP Object Injection.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attack must operate with the permission \"Use PHP to import nodes\", however this could be the case if this issue were combined with others in an \"attack chain\".\n\nIn general, if this module is not in active use it is recommended to disable it.",
