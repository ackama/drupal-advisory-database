  "details": "This module enables you to integrate various What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) rich text editors into Drupal fields with text formats allowing markup for easier editing.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input before attaching a WYSIWYG editor to an input field such as a textarea. If the editor used has an XSS vulnerability this would allow for example a commenter to put specially crafted markup which could trigger the vulnerability when viewed in the editor by an administrator.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission to create content using a text format with an attached and XSS vulnerable rich text editor.",
