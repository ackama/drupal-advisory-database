  "details": "*Updated November 22.*\n\nThis module enables you to collect nodes in an arbitrarily ordered list.\n\nNodequeue's JavaScript can be leveraged to insert HTML from attacker-controlled JSON data. This is exploitable if user-submitted \"Filtered HTML\" content is displayed on a page where nodequeue.js is loaded.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"manipulate queues\".\n\n**Original advisory:**  \n~~The security team is marking this project unsupported. There is a known security issue with the project that has not been fixed by the maintainer.
