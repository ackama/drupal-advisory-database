  "details": "This module extends access handling of Drupal Core's Taxonomy module.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently check,\n\n* if a given entity should be access controlled, defaulting to allowing access even to unpublished Taxonomy Terms.\n* if certain administrative routes should be access controlled, defaulting to allowing access even to users without permission to access these administrative routes.\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated by the facts, that\n\n* the user interface to change the status of Taxonomy Terms has been released in Drupal Core 8.8 and a custom or contributed module is required in earlier versions of Drupal Core to mark Taxonomy Terms as unpublished.\n* all entity operations (except the view operation) available on affected administrative routes still require appropriate permissions.\n* an attacker must have a role with permission to either access content or view a Taxonomy Term in a vocabulary.",
