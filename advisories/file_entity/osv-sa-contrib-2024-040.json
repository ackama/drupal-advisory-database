  "details": "This module enables you to store and manage both private and public files, provides the ability to add fieldable metadata for file\\_entity bundle types in addition to core file\\_managed data.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently ensure that folders exist within the private destination prior to writing to them. If the subfolder doesn't exist, the module places the file in a publicly accessible directory.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects sites with private files.",
