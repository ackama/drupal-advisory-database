  "summary": "",
  "details": "File entity provides interfaces for managing files. It also extends the core file entity, allowing files to be fieldable, grouped into types, viewed (using display modes) and formatted using field formatters.\n\nThe module previously did not sufficiently validate files under the scenario of a file replacement leading to multiple exploit paths including persistent Cross Site Scripting.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission to edit files.",
