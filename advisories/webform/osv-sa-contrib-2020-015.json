  "details": "This module enables you to build forms and surveys in Drupal.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently sanitize Webform labels nor visibility conditions under the scenario of placing a block. When a webform block is placed and visible on a website any JavaScript code contained within the webform's label was executed.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"Edit own webform\" (or \"Edit any webform\").",
