  "details": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/webform\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webform module for Drupal 8/9</a> includes a default Contact webform, which sends a notification email to the site owner and a confirmation email to the email address supplied via the form.</p>\n<p>The confirmation email can be used as an open mail relay to send an email to any email address.  </p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the site owner's email address is also receiving a notification email, which should alert the site owner to the exploitation. If the site owner's mailbox is not monitored, the open mail relay can be more easily exploited.</p>\n<p>With the Webform module's latest release, the default Contact's confirmation email will only be sent to an authenticated user's email address. Anonymous users will no longer receive a confirmation email.  </p>\n<p>If anonymous users need to receive a confirmation email, we recommend you add SPAM protection to the form and update the email handler.</p>",
