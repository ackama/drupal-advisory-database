  "details": "This module provides a site administrator the ability to log users out after a specified time of inactivity. It is highly customizable and includes \"site policies\" by role to enforce log out.\n\nThe module does not sufficiently filter user-supplied text that is stored in the configuration, resulting in a persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS).\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"administer autologout\".",
