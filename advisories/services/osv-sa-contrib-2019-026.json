  "details": "This module provides a standardized solution for building API's so that external clients can communicate with Drupal.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently sanitize user input for entity index resources thus allowing SQL Injection attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the Drupal 7 site must have an \"index\" resource(s) enabled under the Services endpoint configuration (admin/structure/services/list/MY-ENDPOINT/resources) and an attacker must know the endpoint's machine name.\n\nInstall the [7.x-3.22](/project/services/releases/7.x-3.22) version of the Services module for the fix, or simply disable any \"index\" resources to stop the attack vector.",
