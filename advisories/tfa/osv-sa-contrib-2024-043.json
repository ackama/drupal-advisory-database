  "details": "<p>This module enables you to allow and/or require users to use a second authentication method in addition to password authentication.</p>\n<p>The module does not sufficiently migrate sessions before prompting for a second factor token.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must fixate a session on a victim system that is then authenticated with username and password without completing Two Factor authentication. An attacker must gather additional information regarding the entry form after authentication. An attacker must still present a valid token to complete authentication.</p>",
