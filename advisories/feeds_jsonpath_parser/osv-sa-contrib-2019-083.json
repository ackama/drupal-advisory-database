If you would like to maintain this project, please read: <https://www.drupal.org/node/251466#procedure---own-project---unsupported>~~\n\n**Update:**\n\nFeeds Jsonpath Parser has a dependency on the third party Library [peekmo/jsonpath](https://github.com/Peekmo/JsonPath) or [Stefan Goessner's implementation of jsonpath](http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/) which when used with data that has not been sanatized allows arbitrary code to be run.  \nVulnerabilities are possible if a user has permission to configure a feed or the feed is configured such that a user with the access to the import form can alter a field mapping.  \nThe latest version changes the dependency from the aforementioned libraries and changes it to [flow/jsonpath](https://github.com/FlowCommunications/JSONPath) which does not require value sanitation for the same functionality.",
