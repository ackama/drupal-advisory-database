  "summary": "",
  "details": "<p>Gif Player Field creates a simple file field types that allows you to upload the GIF files and configure the output for this using the Field Formatters.</p>\n<p>The module uses <a href=\"https://github.com/rubentd/gifplayer\" rel=\"nofollow\">GifPlayer jQuery library</a> to render the GIF according to configured setups for the Field Formatter. The external Gif Player Library doesn't satinize the attributes properly when rendering the widget, allowing a malicious user to run XSS attacks.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need to have an account on the website and be able to create an image tag with a data-label element. There are no fields that allow that element on a default Drupal site for a user with user-level permissions.</p>",
