  "summary": "",
  "details": "The Opigno TinCan Question Type module is related to Opigno LMS distribution. The module adds a new question type for the Quiz module. With this new question type, you will be able to import TinCan Packages to your Drupal instance and to use it as a question.\n\nUploaded files were not sufficiently validated to prevent arbitrary file uploads, which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and/or Cross Site Scripting (XSS).\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it requires the attacker have a role with the permission to create or edit \"TinCan Package\" content type.",
