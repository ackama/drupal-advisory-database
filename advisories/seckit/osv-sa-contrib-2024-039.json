  "summary": "",
  "details": "<p>This module provides Drupal with various security-hardening options, for example by emitting various configurable HTTP response headers.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't sufficiently validate input in Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports. This can cause errors when a logging module (e.g. dblog or syslog) attempts to parse the resulting log message which contains invalid data. </p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that to be affected a site must have seckit's CSP reporting functionality enabled. Recent versions of Drupal 10 and 11 core are not vulnerable due to <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2481349\" rel=\"nofollow\">improved parsing of log messages</a>.</p>",
