  "details": "This module enables you to filter the list of modules on the admin modules page, and organizes packages into vertical tabs.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently escape HTML under the scenario leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have access to input filtered html that will be included on the modules administration page e.g. in a block (this configuration is not common). Further, the Module Filter vertical tabs setting must be enabled.",
