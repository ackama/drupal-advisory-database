  "details": "This module allows for integration of Signature Pad, an electronic-signing  \nscript, into Drupal for both nodes (content), the Field API (FAPI), and Webforms.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently filter user input when displaying a signature.\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to submit a signature. That permission might be associated with submitting a webform or creating or editing a node depending on site configuration.",
