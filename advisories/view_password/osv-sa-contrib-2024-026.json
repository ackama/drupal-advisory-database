  "details": "<p>The View Password module enables you to add a help icon button next to the password input field to toggle the password visibility. The administrative user is allowed to add classes to this icon for styling purposes.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't validate the content of classes. A malicious user with access to the View Password Settings Form could add malicious code in the classes field.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"administer view password\".</p>",
