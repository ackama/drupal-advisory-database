  "details": "<p>This module enables you to define automations on your Drupal site.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't sufficiently protect certain routes from CSRF attacks.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must get a user with the permission \"administer eca\" to follow to a given site. It can also be mitigated by disabling the \"eca_ui\" submodule, which leaves ECA functionality intact, but the vulnerable routes will no longer be available.</p>",
