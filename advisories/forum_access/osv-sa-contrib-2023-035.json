You can also give each forum a list of users who have administrative access on that forum (AKA moderators). This module requires the ACL module.</p>\n<p>The module processes user input in a way that could be unsafe. This can lead to Remote Code Execution via Object Injection.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker needs the \"administer forums\" permission.</p>\n<p>This Security Advisory is being released in coordination with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2023-034\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA-CONTRIB-2023-034</a> for the ACL module, on which Forum Access depends.</p>",
