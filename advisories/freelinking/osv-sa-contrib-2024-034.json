  "details": "This module enables you to configure a wiki-like input filter that allows users to create links to site and external content.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently check if a user has access to some URLs before rendering them as links.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"access content\" (which is commonly assigned to all roles), and the site must be configured to disallow access to certain content.",
