  "details": "<p>This module enables users to authenticate through their Microsoft Azure AD account.</p>\n<p>The module does not sufficiently check authorization before updating user profile information in certain non-default configurations. This could lead a user being able to hijack another existing account.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have knowledge of user accounts that have the administrator role or accounts with the 'Set a password for local authentication' permission. In addition the site must be configured with the 'Update email address in user profile' setting turned on.</p>",
