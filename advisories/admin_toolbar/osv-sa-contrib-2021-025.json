  "details": "The *Admin Toolbar* (`admin_toolbar`) module extends the default toolbar provided by Drupal Core with various features facilitating day-to-day editorial and administrative work.\n\nThe *Admin Toolbar Search* sub-module of this module\n\n* doesn't sanitize user input in certain cases, which leads to a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker that can create or edit certain entities, entity bundles or entity types may be able to exploit one or more Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to target users with access to the *Admin Toolbar Search* search box, including site admins with privileged access.\n* doesn't properly check access in certain cases, which may result in an information disclosure vulnerability of entity type and bundle labels.\n\nThe vulnerability is mitigated by the facts, that:\n\n* the *Admin Toolbar Search* sub-module must be enabled.\n* an attacker must have one of several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only assigned to either editors, site builders or administrators.\n* a targeted account must have permission to use the search box provided by the *Admin Toolbar Search* sub-module.",
