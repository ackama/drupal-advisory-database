An attacker that can create or edit certain entities, entity bundles or entity types may be able to exploit one or more Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to target users with access to the <em>Admin Toolbar Search</em> search box, including site admins with privileged access.</li>\n<li>doesn't properly check access in certain cases, which may result in an information disclosure vulnerability of entity type and bundle labels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The vulnerability is mitigated by the facts, that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <em>Admin Toolbar Search</em> sub-module must be enabled.</li>\n<li>an attacker must have one of several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only assigned to either editors, site builders or administrators.</li>\n<li>a targeted account must have permission to use the search box provided by the <em>Admin Toolbar Search</em> sub-module.</li>\n</ul>",
