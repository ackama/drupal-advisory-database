  "details": "This module provides a phone field for Drupal 7 that supports the HTML5 tel:-schema.\n\nIn an API function that is not used by the module, the name for the phone field is not sufficiently sanitised when using it in database queries.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it affects an unused function. A site is only vulnerable if it has custom code that uses the `phonefield_get_entity_id()` function and exposes control over the `$field` parameter to visitors to the site.",
