  "summary": "",
  "details": "This module enables you to manage blocks from specific modules in the specific themes.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently check permissions under the scenario when a block is added using the form \"/admin/structure/block/add/{plugin\\_id}/{theme}\" (route \"block.admin\\_add\"). The attacker can add the block to the theme where they can't manage blocks.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission \"administer blocks provided by [provider]\".",
