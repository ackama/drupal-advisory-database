  "details": "This module enables you to generate print versions of content.  \nSome installations of the module make use of the dompdf/dompdf third-party dependency.  \nSecurity vulnerabilities exist for versions of dompdf/dompdf < 2.0.0\n\nSee the library release notes for more detail: <https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases/tag/v2.0.0>\n\n### Note on 3rd party vulnerabilities\n\nThis security advisory corresponds to a 3rd party vulnerability. Normally the Drupal Security Team would not issue advisories related to 3rd party code that is shipped separately from a module per our policy (most recent update is [PSA-2019-09-04](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-09-04)). In this case, because the module required a specific version and could not be updated without a change to the Drupal module we do issue an advisory.",
