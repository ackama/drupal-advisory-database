Normally the Drupal Security Team would not issue advisories related to 3rd party code that is shipped separately from a module per our policy (most recent update is <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-09-04\" rel=\"nofollow\">PSA-2019-09-04</a>). In this case, because the module required a specific version and could not be updated without a change to the Drupal module we do issue an advisory.</p>",
