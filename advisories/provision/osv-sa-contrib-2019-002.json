  "details": "Aegir is a Web hosting control panel program that provides a Drupal-based graphical interface designed to simplify deploying, managing and upgrading an entire network of Drupal, Wordpress and CiviCRM Web sites. The Provision module is a core piece of the Aegir platform.\n\nThis module doesn't sufficiently shield multi-site installations or the PHP source code.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the server must be using Apache. For multi-site installations, the server must host multiple sites on a common platform. Additionally an attacker must have a knowledge about used filenames and the server.",
