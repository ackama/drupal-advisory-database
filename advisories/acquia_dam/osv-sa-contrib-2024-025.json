  "details": "Acquia DAM provides a connection to a third-party asset management system, allowing for images to be managed, linked to, and viewed from Drupal. In order for assets to be managed in Drupal, a site administrator must first authenticate the site to their DAM instance.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently protect the ability to disconnect a site from DAM. While disconnected sites do not lose asset data in Drupal, it will prevent site editors from accessing the DAM until a site administrator re-authenticates the site. Some uncached media images may also fail to be fetched while disconnected.",
