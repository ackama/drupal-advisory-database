  "summary": "",
  "details": "<p>This module enables you to obfuscate email addresses, to avoid them being easily available to spammers.</p>\n<p>The module doesn't sufficiently sanitise input when ROT13 encoding is used.<br />\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the ability to enter specific HTML tag attributes. In a default Drupal installation this would require the administrator role and use of the Full HTML text format. It also requires that the ROT13 encoding be enabled in Obfuscate settings.</p>",
