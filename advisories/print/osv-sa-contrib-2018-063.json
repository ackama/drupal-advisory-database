  "details": "This module provides printer-friendly versions of content, including send by e-mail and PDF versions.\n\nThe module doesn't sufficiently sanitize the arguments passed to the wkhtmltopdf executable, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands. It also doesn't sufficiently sanitize the HTML content passed to dompdf, allowing a privileged attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the site must have either the wkhtmltopdf or dompdf sub-modules enabled and selected as the PDF generation tool. In the case of the dompdf vulnerability, the attacker must be able to write content to the site.",
