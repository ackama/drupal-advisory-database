  "details": "This module enables the user to set custom permissions per path.\n\nThe module doesn't perform sufficient checks on paths with dynamic arguments (like \"node/1\" or \"user/2\"), thereby allowing the site administrator to save custom permissions for paths that won't be protected. This could lead to an access bypass vulnerability if the site is relying on the Custom Permissions module to protect those paths.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs on sites which attempted to use the Custom Permissions module to protect dynamic paths.",
