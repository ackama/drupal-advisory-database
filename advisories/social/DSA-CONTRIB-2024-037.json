  "details": "Open Social is a Drupal distribution for online communities, which ships with an optional module called Social Embed.\n\nThis module allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.\n\nAdded URL's were not sufficiently validated which could lead to a DoS via Blind SSRF and/or Application Takeover via Stored XSS.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that social\\_embed submodule needs to be enabled.",
